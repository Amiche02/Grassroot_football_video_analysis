# GRASSROOT FOOTBALL ANALYSIS

## Project Objective

The **Grassroot Football Analysis** project aims to develop a comprehensive system for analyzing grassroots football match videos using advanced **AI techniques** and **Big Data infrastructure**. By leveraging state-of-the-art **player detection, tracking, and performance analysis tools**, this initiative seeks to support training strategies, improve player development, gain tactical insights, and enhance fan engagement.

This project integrates:
- **Player tracking, speed estimation, and ball movement analysis**
- **Automatic team identification using clustering**
- **Big Data management for large-scale football video datasets**
- **Tactical analysis to improve performance and game strategies**

## Features

‚úÖ **Player Detection & Tracking**: Identifies and follows players using **YOLOv5 & YOLOv8**  
‚úÖ **Camera Motion Estimation**: Adjusts player positions for accurate tracking  
‚úÖ **Field View Transformation**: Corrects perspective distortions for an ideal tactical view  
‚úÖ **Ball Position Interpolation**: Estimates ball location when not directly visible  
‚úÖ **Player Speed & Distance Estimation**: Analyzes movement patterns and fitness levels  
‚úÖ **Team Classification via Clustering**: Uses **K-Means clustering** to automatically group players by team colors  
‚úÖ **Ball Possession Analysis**: Determines which team controls the ball  
‚úÖ **Big Data Video Management**: Handles **500+ grassroots match videos** for long-term tracking and analysis
